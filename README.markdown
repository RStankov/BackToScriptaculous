Back to scriptaculous
=========

## A backward lib between scriptaculous and scripty2
Back to scriptaculous is an open source project, who is trying to import as much as possible from scriptaculous to the new awesome Scripty2 engine.

## Building

To build back.js file containing latest prototype.js / scripty2 and Back to scriptaculous files just run:

  rake dist
  
## Imported Effects

Appear, BlindDown, BlindUp, DropOut, Fade, Highlight, Move, Scale, ScrollTo, SlideDown, SlideUp, Squish

Imported effects use almost the same functional test from scriptaculous - in test/run_functional_tests.html

## Contributing

All source code is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/).
